# PokedexVueJs

## Goal
To learn a new JS language alongside another frontend framework similar to Bootstrap.

## Future of this project
It was a great three weeks working on this. I learned a lot and overcame a few challenges. I know for a fact that I would love to keep this pokedex up-to-date whenever possible, so I am open-sourcing this project to anyone.

## Recent Update
- Added more pokemons from Ultra Sun and Moon
- You can now ask questions like ```Who is the fastest?```

## Updating to v2
For version 2, I plan on doing the following:
- Expanding the API to include more data
- Break up the API data into smaller chucks
- Redesign the current UI of the pokemon page
- Add unit tests to calculating methods
- Make it mobile-friendly (if possible with Chart.js)

To improve performance, I will be just using a json within the static file. In addition, I will be rewriting the frontend again to make it more clean and and reuseable.

## Languages/Framework/Database used
- Vue.js
- Bulma
- Python
- MongoDB

## Challenges I faced
1. Searching multiple categories

One of the issues I faced within my search function is how to search through the data based on a number like 2. I been stuck on this problem for about a day. As I am still unfamilar with Vue.js, I thought that there was a way to filter out the data strictly using an int. I first attempted it using: 
```vue.js
return this.pokemonList.filter(pokemon => { 
				return (pokemon.nDex.indexOf(this.search >= 0);
```

but it ended being an error. My next attempt was google it. I came upon an answer on stack overflow which has them using ```.includes()```. I tried that and did not work. It also turns out that ```.includes()``` was removed in version 2 of Vuejs. My third attempt which was successful was to just think of integer as a string instead. So when I type in a number into the search bar, it will automatically be converted to a string. To do that, I used ```.toString()```. If you are wondering how the code looks like, it would look like this:
```vue.js
return this.pokemonList.filter(pokemon => { 
				return (pokemon.nDex.toString().indexOf(this.search.toString() >= 0);
```

Now my search functionality works perfectly and I can search through multiple categories like nDex, name and even type! What I learned from this challenge I faced is if you cannot find an answer via google, think of how you would write this in another language.

2. Using x-template

As I decided to learn how to use templates instead, I had to slightly change my code in the HTML side for the modal to pop up. Unfornately I keep getting errors such as ```Property or method is not defined on the instance but referenced during render```. My initial thought is that the method call is out of scope as it was in ```pokedex``` and not ```poke-table```. After some searching, it turns out that x-template was the problem itself. Apparently you are supposed to put it in a new variable and call that variable when you want to use it as a Vue template. So it would look like this:
```vue.js
var pokeTable = {
	template: '#poke-table',
	props: {
		data: Array,
		columns: Array,
		filterKey: String
	},

	data: function() {
		var sortOrders = {}
		this.columns.forEach(function(key) {
			sortOrders[key] = 1
		})
		return {
			sortKey: '',
			sortOrders: sortOrders
		}
	},

	computed: {...}
	...
};

Vue.component('poke-table', pokeTable);
```

3. Easily forgotten mistake

Within the input field, I can enter a number and it would be used to calculate the pokemon's stats. However one problem I faced is when I wanted to change the level of the pokemon... let's say from 1 to 100, my HP stat would skyrocket to the 10000s. After about 10 minutes of checking out my JS code, I realized that I made a very forgetful and common mistake. I thought that the number I input would be of type ```Int```, however it is actually of type ```String```. I fixed this by surround the value with ```parseInt()``` to make it of type ```Int```.

4. Finding websites to scrape

One of the hugest issues I have when I am trying to scape for data is trying to find a perfect site with all of the stats I needed. I found three which are worthy, which are Bulbapedia, Serebii and Smogon. Bulbapedia was the easiest to scrape. If I was not using Bulbapedia I would had use Serebii. Smogon had all of the tier information which I needed, BUT it was a pain in the ass to scrape. I kind of wish there was already an API or another site that included tiers (AG, Uber, OU etc.) as part of their data.

For the future, I plan on building a better scraper so I do not need to manually go through all of the data to ensure that I did not skip one.

## Bugs that needs to be fix
- ~~When opening up the modal. The initial value is set to the previous stats of another Pokemon when hovering closely~~
  - Fixed using variableOfChart.destroy();
- ~~Stats would constantly change every time you click "update" to the past duplicate pokemon~~
  - This is due the json not having an unique id. All you need to do is create one and it will fix this problem

## How to run
To install of the NPM modules, enter code below on terminal:
```
npm install
```
*Note: For nodemon, you may need to run it as* ```npm install -g nodemon```

To run locally, set up the mongoDB instance first by entering: ```mongod``` then open up another terminal tab. Go to the pokeScraper directory by entering ```cd ./pokeScraper``` then import the ```pokedex.json``` file into the DB using:

```
mongoimport --jsonArray --db DATABASENAME --collection COLLECTIONNAME --file pokedex.json
```
*Note: Use ```mongopokedex.json``` if you wish to import it to a database like mLabs*

If you wish to export it from your local mongoDB, enter this command into the terminal:

```
mongoexport --db DATABASENAME --collection COLLECTIONNAME --out NAME.json
```

Lastly, run:

```
npm start
```
*Note: Implement your own MONGODB_URI variable!*
